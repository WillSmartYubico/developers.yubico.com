== OpenSSH Certificates

OpenSSH supports a proprietary version of certificates that allow
simple login to hosts.

=== Traditional Method

The usual way to enable a user `U` to access a specific host `H` using
SSH is to copy the public key of `U` in a file on `H` (typically
called `authorized_keys`).

This method suffers from a lack of generality. If another user `U'`
were to be given access to `H`, their public key should also be copied
in that same file. At the same time, if `U` were to be given access to
a different host `H'`, their public key would have to be added to an
equivalent file on that host.

While various automatic provisioning systems have been devised, those
still represent a workaround rather than a solution to the problem.

=== OpenSSH CA

Since version `5.4` (released 2010-03-08) OpenSSH has had support for
so-called _OpenSSH Certificates_.

By using these, only one OpenSSH CA public key has to be copied onto
the target host. At that point any user can be granted access to any
such host by giving them a file that contains the following
information: their own public key, a validity period, a list of
usernames that the user it allowed to login as and a digital signature
over the whole content created using the private key of an SSH CA.

This file, the SSH Certificate, is then automatically presented to
the SSH server by the SSH client of the user as part of the login
process.

=== OpenSSH Certificates with YubiHSM

The private key of an SSH CA is a regular private key and can be stored
on a YubiHSM 2. OpenSSH has builtin support for signing SSH Certificates
using CA private keys that reside on a hardware token through the PKCS#11
interface. The YubiHSM 2 supports signing SSH Certificates using a RSA CA key.
This guide will describe how to leverage that.

=== High-level Description and components

A YubiHSM device is able to sign OpenSSH public keys when those are
submitted to the device as part of a specific format that we call
`OpenSSH Certificate Request`.

Such a request is granted (i.e., the signature is computed and
released), if and only if the following two requirements are
fulfilled:

 - the user who sends the request to the device has the right
   privileges to access the OpenSSH CA private key on the device;
 - the OpenSSH Certificate Request meets a series of
   pre-defined constraints.

The first requirement is fulfilled by making sure that the user
submitting the request (who may not be the same one who generates
the request) can establish a Session with the device through an
Authentication Key that has access to the necessary Domains and has
the necessary Capability set.

The second requirement is fulfilled by encoding those pre-defined
constraints in an object with Type `Template` and Algorithm `SSH
Template`.

=== SSH Template

An `SSH Template` is a binary object that can be used to restrict how
and when an SSH CA private key should be used to sign SSH Certificate
Requests.

This is a binary object that encodes a series of constraints. Its
format is a collection of Tag-Length-Value tuples whose meaning is
described below:

[options="header"]
|===
| Tag Value | Tag Description |
| 0x01 | Timestamp key algorithm |
| 0x02 | Timestamp public key |
| 0x03 | CA key white-list |
| 0x04 | Not before |
| 0x05 | Not after |
| 0x06 | Principals black-list |
|===

The individual tags are further explained below.

==== Timestamp Key Algorithm

The link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] of the public key used to
verify timestamp signatures.

==== Timestamp Public Key

The public key used to verify timestamp signatures.

==== CA Key White-list

The list of link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object IDs] describing
which Asymmetric Keys can be used with this template.

==== Not Before

The `Not Before` time offset to be applied to the current time. If a
request contains a time value that is before this computed timestamp,
an error will be returned.

==== Not After

The `Not After` time offset to be applied to the current time. If a
request contains a time value that is after this computed timestamp,
an error will be returned.

==== Principals Black-list

The `nul`-separated, `nul`-terminated list of Principals (user names) for which a
certificate will not be issued.

=== SSH Certificate Request

An SSH certificate format is defined by OpenSSH but it is not too
dissimilar from an X.509 certificate. At its core it is a collection
of attributes, a time period, a public key and a signature over all
the data.

An SSH Certificate Request is the set of information that must be sent
to a YubiHSM so that it can generate the aforementioned signature.
This consists of all the data present in the certificate (excluding
the signature).

==== Signing an SSH Certificate Request

Once an SSH Template has been stored on the YubiHSM and an SSH
Certificate Request has been created, it can be sent to the device for
signing.

This is done by issuing the
link:../Commands/Sign_Ssh_Certificate.adoc[Sign SSH Certificate]
Command. The parameters required are:

- the link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the SSH CA key
  which has already been stored on the device

- the link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the SSH
  Template to use in order to validate the request

- the link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] to use to produce the
  certificate signature

- the timestamp with the definition of `Now`

- the signature `S~T~` over the SSH Certificate Request and the
  timestamp

- the SSH Certificate Request

After the command is issued, the following steps take place in the
YubiHSM. First the the signature `S~T~` is verified using the public
key present within the specified SSH Template. If the verification is
successful, the value of `Now` is recorded. Next the SSH Certificate
Request is parsed to extract the `Not Before` and `Not After`
timestamps together with the list of Principals. The following checks
are then performed:

- the ID of the SSH CA key must appear in the SSH CA key white-list
  present in the SSH Template

- the `Not Before` timestamp in the SSH Certificate Request must be
  greater than or equal to `Now` plus the `Not Before` offset
  specified in the SSH Template

- the `Not After` timestamp in the SSH Certificate Request must be
  less than or equal to `Now` plus the `Not After` offset specified in
  the SSH Template

- none of the Principals specified in the SSH Certificate Request must
  appear in the Principals black-list SSH Template

If all the constraints were fulfilled, the YubiHSM will produce a
signature using the Algorithm specified in the command. This signature
can be appended to the SSH Certificate Request to produce a valid SSH
Certificate.
