== Accessing administrative functions
PIV provides two different levels of access. One is the end-user (cardholder)
level, which is protected by a PIN. This level allows normal day-to-day usage
of the PIV functionality. The second is an administrator level, which is
protected by a management key. This level allows provisioning of credentials.

=== PIN/PUK
End-user functionality is guarded by a PIN, which needs to be provided by the
user to perform private key operations. The PIN can be up to 8 characters long,
and supports any type of alphanumeric characters. If the PIN is entered
incorrectly 3 times consecutively, the PIN will be blocked and unable to be
used. If the PIN is lost or blocked it can be reset using a PUK. The PUK has
the same restrictions as the PIN. If both the PIN and the PUK have been blocked
they can be reset using a specific command. This will reset the PIN, PUK and
Management Key to their default values, as well as delete any stored
certificates and keys. The default values for the PIN and PUK are 123456 and
12345678, respectively.

=== Management Key
Administrative/Management functionality is guarded by a 24 byte management key.
This key is required for administrative tasks, such as generating/importing
keys and certificate into the PIV slots. The default value of the Management
Key for the YubiKey is:

----
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708
