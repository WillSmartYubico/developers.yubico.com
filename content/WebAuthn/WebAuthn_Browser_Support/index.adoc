== WebAuthn Compatibility ==
WebAuthn support is not uniform across browsers. For services implementing WebAuthn, it is vital to note which user environments are supported, and have the appropriate error handling in the event of an unsupported browser.

==== Features ====

*link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#test-of-user-presence[User Presence]* - The browser supports a physical user interaction to establish an event is not being initiated by a remote attacker.  Support for user presence is mandatory for environments supporting WebAuthn, and for devices to be certified by the FIDO alliance.  Support for Resident Key / Discoverable Credentials, User Verification or Passkeys means User Presence over FIDO2 is possible. 

*link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#resident-credential[Resident Key / Discoverable Credential]* - The browser supports WebAuthn credentials stored on the authenticator. These credentials can be read to identify the user account without the user manually providing them.

*link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#user-verification[User Verification (PIN / Biometric)]* - The browser supports an interface to allow a user to verify their identity via entering a WebAuthn PIN or Biometric.

*link:https://developers.yubico.com/Passkeys/[Passkeys]* - The browser supports securely creating and using passkeys on a roaming authenticator.

*link:https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.2-ps-20170411/fido-u2f-overview-v1.2-ps-20170411.html[CTAP 1 / U2F Legacy Support]* - The browser has legacy support for authenticators only supporting User Presence over U2F.

*Browsers on iOS are not able to set a PIN for user verification (UV) if one is not already set.  Requests to create a credential that requires UV may appear to succeed, but create a credential that will not require a PIN.

=== iPadOS 17.4.1 ===
Verified with iPad 6th generation (Lightning), iPad Air (USB-C) 4th generation, and iPad Pro 2018 (USB-C)

Most browsers on Apple mobile devices use link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit[Apple WebKit]. As such, these browsers will have all the same functionality available.

NFC tests have been excluded since NFC is not supported on iPadOS browsers.
USB-C is only available on iPad Pro and 4th and 5th generation iPad Air models.

=== Android 14 ===
Verified with Pixel 6 & Google Play Services 24.16

Android support for FIDO2 is linked to Google Play Services, and may be available on link:https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7165974[Google Play Protect] certified devices running Android 9 or later, as long as they are running a current version of Google Play Services, and have a screen lock configured.

Currently the Android platform only supports the CTAP 1 (U2F) protocol over NFC.
Support for Resident Keys / Discoverable Credentials, User Verification, and passkeys is available over USB.
