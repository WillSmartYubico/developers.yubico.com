== Resetting Device to Factory Settings

Before deploying the YubiHSM 2 in a production environment, it may be
necessary to reset the device to its factory settings, for instance in
order to facilitate tests or training.

A reset destroys any objects stored on the device that is not factory-installed.

=== Physical Reset

The device can be physically reset to its factory settings. To do
this, while inserting the device into a USB port, press the metal rim
as you insert the device and continue to press the rim for a minimum
of 10 seconds.

=== Reset Using YubiHSM Shell

Please refer to documentation of the link:../Commands/Reset_Device.adoc[Reset] command.
