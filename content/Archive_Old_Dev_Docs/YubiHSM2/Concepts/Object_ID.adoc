== Object ID

The ID property is used to identify an Object of a given Type. This means that to *uniquely* identify an Object stored on a YubiHSM 2, the couple `(Type, ID)` is required. There can be more than one Object with a given ID and more than one Object with a given Type, but only one Object with a specific ID and Type. This is so that logical connections between Objects can be established by giving a set of connected Objects of different Types the same ID.

An Object ID can have values in the range `[0-65535]` or `[0x0000-0xffff]` in hexadecimal. Note that this range is larger than the maximum number of Objects that can be stored in the device (256). Regardless of the type, ID `0x0000` and `0xffff` are reserved for internal Objects.

== Protocol Details

Object IDs are encoded as 16-bit values.
