== Attestation

Asymmetric keys in the YubiHSM can be attested by another Asymmetric key. The attestation process creates a new x509 certificate for the attested key.

The device comes pre-loaded with an attestation key and certificate referenced by ID `0`. It is possible to use your own key and certificate for attestation, these then have to have the same ID and the key has to have the `sign-attestation-certificate` Capability set.

=== Details

* Public key will be copied from the attested key
* Serial will be a random 16 byte integer
* Issuer will be the subject of the attesting certificate
* Dates will be copied from the attesting certificate
* Subject will be the string "YubiHSM Attestation id 0x" with the attested ID appended
* If the attesting key is RSA the signature will be SHA256-PKCS#1v1.5
* If the attesting key is EC the signature will be ECDSA-SHA256

=== Certificate Extensions

Some certificate extensions are added in the generated certificate and the pre-loaded certificate:

=== Pre-loaded certificates

The pre-loaded certificate can be fetched as an opaque object with ID `0`. This will in turn be signed by an intermediate CA which is signed by a link:yubihsm2-attest-ca-crt.pem[Yubico root CA].
