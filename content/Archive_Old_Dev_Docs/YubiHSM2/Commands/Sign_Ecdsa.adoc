== SIGN ECDSA

Sign data with ECDSA.

== Description

Computes a digital signature using ECDSA on the provided data.

== Shell Example

Sign data in file `data` using key `0x52b6` and put the result in file `sig`:

  yubihsm> sign ecdsa 0 0x52b6 ecdsa-sha256 data sig

== Protocol Details

=== Command

|===============
|T~c~ = 0x56
|L~c~ = 2 + L~D~
|V~c~ = I \|\| D
|===============

I := link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the Asymmetric Key (2 bytes)

D := H

The DSI for ECDSA is a possibly zero-left-padded hash of the data, `H`.

=== Response

|============
|T~r~ = 0xd6
|L~r~ = L~DS~
|V~r~ = DS
|============

DS := Resulting signature

The length of `DS`, L~DS~, depends on the link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] used and equals the length
of the signature plus its DER encoding.
