== DECRYPT PKCS1

Decrypt data that was encrypted using RSA-PKCS#1v1.5.

== Description

Decrypt data encrypted with RSA-PKCS#1v1.5

== Shell Example

Decrypt the file `enc` using key `0xa930`:

  yubihsm> decrypt pkcs1v1_5 0 0xa930 enc
  xlwIc7yQf/KkV5v4Y87Q9ZSqLReoNAxlCmmMPA4W08U=

== Protocol Details

=== Command

|==================
|T~c~ = 0x49
|L~c~ = 2 + L~D~
|V~c~ = I \|\| D
|==================

I := link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the Asymmetric Key (2 bytes)

D := Decryption data (256, 384 or 512 bytes)

The data is padded using the PKCS#1v1.5 scheme with `Block Type 2`. The
data is decrypted and conformance to the padding scheme must be checked.
Padding is then removed and the contained message is returned.

=== Response

|===========
|T~r~ = 0xc9
|L~r~ = L~R~
|V~r~ = R
|===========

R := Decrypted data with padding removed
