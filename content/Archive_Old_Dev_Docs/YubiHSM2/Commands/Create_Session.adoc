== CREATE SESSION

Begin the mutual authentication process for establishing a link:../Concepts/Session.adoc[Session].

== Description

Start negotiating a Session with the device. This command tells the device
which Authentication Key to use and sends the host challenge part. The response will
contain the device challenge and device authentication part. To establish
the session continue with link:Authenticate_Session.adoc[Authenticate Session].

== Shell Example

Create a new session with Authentication Key `1` using the password `password`. This does
both the session creation and authentication steps:

  yubihsm> session open 1 password
  Created session 0

== Protocol Details

=== Command

|=============
|T~c~ = 0x03
|L~c~ = 10
|V~c~ = I \|\| H
|=============

I := Key set ID (2 bytes)

H := Host Challenge (8 bytes)

The device generates a random Card Challenge `C` (8 bytes).

The device derives three Session Keys (`S-ENC`, `S-MAC` and `S-RMAC`) starting
from the set of two static keys identified by `I` (`K-ENC` and `K-MAC`) and
the two challenges `H` and `C`, using the same procedure described in SCP03.

The device uses `S-MAC` together with `H` and `C` to compute the Card Cryptogram
`A`. The host will compute the Host Cryptogram `B` after having received `C`
and derived `S-MAC`.

On success the device generates a Session ID `S` (1 byte) and sets the
message counter for the current Session to `1`.

=== Response

|==================
|T~r~ = 0x83
|L~r~ = 17
|V~r~ = S \|\| C \|\| A
