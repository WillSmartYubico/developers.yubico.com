== Python Library

The link:/python-yubihsm/[Python library] allows you to interface with a YubiHSM 2 through
the Connector service using the Python programming language. It supports both Python 2 and 3.

The recommended way to install the library is by using `pip` inside a
`virtualenv`. To create and activate a virtualenv, just run:

....
$ virtualenv yubihsm
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python3
New python executable in /home/user/yubihsm/bin/python3
Also creating executable in /home/user/yubihsm/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pkg_resources, pip, wheel...done.

$ source yubihsm/bin/activate
(yubihsm) $ pip install yubihsm[http,usb]
Collecting yubihsm-2.0.0

NOTE: The `cryptography` dependency uses C extensions, and therfore has some build
dependencies. For detailed instructions on getting building, see:

# Connect to the Connector and establish a session using the default auth key:
hsm = YubiHsm.connect("http://localhost:12345")
session = hsm.create_session_derived(1, "password")

# Create a new EC key for signing:
key = AsymmetricKey.generate(session, 0, "EC Key", 1, CAPABILITY.SIGN_ECDSA, ALGORITHM.EC_P256)

# Sign a message
data = b'Hello world!'
signature = key.sign_ecdsa(data)

# Delete the key from the YubiHSM 2
key.delete()

# Close session and connection:
session.close()
hsm.close()
