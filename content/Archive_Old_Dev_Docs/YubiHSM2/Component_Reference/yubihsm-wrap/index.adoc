== Yubihsm Wrap

link:/yubihsm-shell/yubihsm-wrap.html[Yubihsm Wrap] is a tool that allows to create importable objects offline. This is useful when bootstrapping secrets for example on an air-gapped computer.

The tool requires an unencrypted Wrap Key in binary format and uses that to wrap objects with given link:../../Concepts/Object.adoc[Type], link:../../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm], link:../../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[ID], link:../../Concepts/Capability.adoc[Capabilities] and where applicable link:../../Concepts/Capability.adoc[Delegated Capabilities].

For the resulting Object to be successfully imported on a YubiHSM 2, the Wrap Key used by `yubihsm-wrap` must already be present on the device.

Currently not all Object Types are supported. Refer to link:../../Releases/Known_issues.adoc[Known Issues and Limitations] for more information.
