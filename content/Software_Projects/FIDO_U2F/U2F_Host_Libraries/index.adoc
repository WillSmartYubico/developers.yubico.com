== U2F Host Libraries

[Note]
======
The U2F libraries are now deprecated and no longer maintained. We highly recommend transitioning to the FIDO2 libraries for enhanced security and compatibility.

======

These libraries deal with communication on the (end-user) host side of things,
such as handing data from a U2F enabled server and passing it to a U2F device
connected over USB. If a U2F enabled web browser is going to be used by the end
user, then these libraries should not be needed.
