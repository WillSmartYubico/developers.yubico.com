== U2F Server Libraries

[Note]
======
The U2F libraries are now deprecated and no longer maintained. We highly recommend transitioning to the FIDO2 libraries for enhanced security and compatibility.

Python:: link:/python-fido2/[python-fido2]


Learn more about link:/Passkeys[Passkeys], link:/WebAuthn[WebAuthn], and link:/CTAP[CTAP].
======

These libraries deal with the low level primitives of the U2F protocol and are
a good starting point for anyone intending to implement their own U2F server.
