== One-Time Password (OTP) Walk-Through

=== Overview

We are going to go through integrating the Yubico One-Time Password (OTP) protocol with your application or framework, step by step. This updated guide focuses on using the cloud-based YubiOTP validation service (YubiCloud) at `api.yubico.com``.

TIP: This walk-through is designed for people who prefer learning by doing. If you prefer to learn concepts from the ground up, check out our link:https://resources.yubico.com/53ZDUYE6/as/pvknxfcmgb2kv6bjw8pvp2k/YubiKey-Authentication-Module-Design-Guideline-v10.pdf[YubiKey Authentication Module Design Guideline] from 2012. The guide and this walk-through are complementary.

=== Overview of OTP

With One-Time Password (OTP), symmetric-key cryptography is used to authenticate users against a central server, known as a Relying Party (RP). The OTP is validated by a central server when users log into your application.

* **At production:** A symmetric key is generated and loaded on the YubiKey. This can be done by Yubico for YubiCloud users or by the user directly.
* **OTP Generation:** The YubiKey generates an OTP when a user requests to log in. This OTP is sent to the verification server (YubiCloud or a link:https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Yubico_OTP/YubiCloud_Validation_Servers/[self-hosted server]).
* **OTP Validation:** The server validates the OTP and confirms that it belongs to the user.

=== Prerequisites

* A computer with browser access
* A link:https://www.yubico.com/products/[YubiKey]

=== Setup

Incorporating YubiKey authentication into your application involves the following components:

. **Verification server:** YubiCloud or a link:https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Yubico_OTP/YubiCloud_Validation_Servers/[self-hosted server]
. **YubiKey API authenticator:** YubiKey for generating OTPs
. **Verification client:** Your application’s logic for communicating with YubiCloud
. **Authentication logic:** Code for handling user registration and login

=== Enable Your YubiKey API Authenticator
. Sign up for and acquire your API key:
* Go to the link:https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey[Yubico API key signup] page.
* Enter your email address and generate an OTP from your YubiKey.
* Accept the Terms and Conditions and click "Get API key."
* Record the Client ID and Secret Key. These values authenticate your users with the YubiCloud.

=== Create Your Verification Client
For this phase, you'll create a client to communicate with the YubiCloud. Here's a basic example using an HTTP GET request:

**Using a Custom YubiCloud Client**

. **Send requests:**
+
[source, javascript]
```
const clientId = 'your-client-id';
const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';
const otp = 'generated-otp-from-yubikey';

const url = `https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify?id=${clientId}&otp=${otp}&nonce=${generateNonce()}`;
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    if (data.status === 'OK') {
      console.log('OTP is valid');
    } else {
      console.error('OTP validation failed:', data.status);
    }
  });
```
+
. **Generate and verify signatures:**
* Use the link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/Specifications/OTP_validation_protocol.html[Yubico OTP Validation Protocol Version 2.0] to construct and verify signatures.
. **Associated the YubiKey ID with the User ID**
* Modhex (modified hexadecimal) is a base-16 encoding method that YubiKeys use to ensure compatibility with different keyboard layouts. Here is an example of converting between hex and modhex in JavaScript:
+
[source, javascript]
```
// Convert hex to modhex
function hexToModhex(hex) {
  const modhexMap = {
    '0': 'c', '1': 'b', '2': 'd', '3': 'e', '4': 'f', '5': 'g', '6': 'h', '7': 'i',
    '8': 'j', '9': 'k', 'a': 'l', 'b': 'n', 'c': 'r', 'd': 't', 'e': 'u', 'f': 'v'
  };
  return hex.split('').map(char => modhexMap[char.toLowerCase()]).join('');
}

// Convert modhex to hex
function modhexToHex(modhex) {
  const hexMap = {
    'c': '0', 'b': '1', 'd': '2', 'e': '3', 'f': '4', 'g': '5', 'h': '6', 'i': '7',
    'j': '8', 'k': '9', 'l': 'a', 'n': 'b', 'r': 'c', 't': 'd', 'u': 'e', 'v': 'f'
  };
  return modhex.split('').map(char => hexMap[char.toLowerCase()]).join('');
}

// Example usage:
const hexKey = 'abcdef1234567890';
const modhexKey = hexToModhex(hexKey);
console.log('Modhex Key:', modhexKey);

const backToHex = modhexToHex(modhexKey);
console.log('Back to Hex:', backToHex);
```
+
* Extract the YubiKey ID save to the user's credential repository
+
[source, javascript]
```
// Example OTP from YubiKey
const otp = 'cccccccfhjfjkknvubekedkrncrkruvvkiutlfibngd';

// Extract the YubiID (first 12 characters)
const yubiID = otp.substring(0, 12);
console.log('YubiID (modhex):', yubiID);

// Convert YubiID from modhex to hex if needed
const hexYubiID = modhexToHex(yubiID);
console.log('YubiID (hex):', hexYubiID);
```

=== Add Authentication Logic to Your Application
In your application, add the logic needed to process registration and authentication requests.

**User Registration**

. Expose a connection to your UI to accept the OTP for launching the application.
. Use the YubiKey Public ID to associate it with the registering user.
. Store the YubiKeyID : UserID pairs in your database.
. Add logic to check the UserID for a valid OTP response from the YubiCloud validation server.

**User Authentication**

. Retrieve the OTP from an inserted and tapped YubiKey.
. Pass the OTP to your YubiCloud client.
. Parse the YubiCloud response.
. Verify the YubiKey public ID against the user ID pair in your database.
. Authenticate the user if the OTP is valid.

=== Wrapping Up
Congratulations! You’ve completed the steps to enable your users to register and authenticate with an OTP credential.
