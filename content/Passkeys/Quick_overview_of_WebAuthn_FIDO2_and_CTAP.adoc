Overview of how FIDO2, CTAP, and WebAuthn work to create passkey experiences

Before we dive into passkeys, let’s go through a quick history of how we got to this point. There are a few concepts that help enable passkeys as a technology. It will be beneficial for you as an integrator of passkeys to be familiar with these terms.

== WebAuthn

The Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) allows for the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public-key based credentials for authenticating users. A server is able to invoke the API through a client application in order to perform two ceremonies: registration and authentication.

Registration allows a client application to work with a supporting authenticator to create a public key credential. This credential is sent to the backend application where it can be used to verify challenges signed by its corresponding private key during authentication ceremonies.

Registration requests are invoked using the `navigator.credentials.create()` method.

Authentication allows a client application to work with a supporting authenticator to sign a challenge, issued by the backend application. This verification is completed using the device's private key. The signed challenge is returned to the backend application, where the public key captured during registration validates the challenge.

Authentication requests are invoked using the `navigator.credentials.get()` method.

Both the `get()` and `create()` API are supported by all of the major browsers, allowing web applications to seamlessly provide support for the protocol across ecosystems. 

== CTAP
The client to authenticator protocol (CTAP) is an application layer protocol that is used for communication between a client or platform, and an external authenticator. This is primarily used in scenarios where an authenticator like a security key is used to perform the WebAuthn operations. 

== FIDO2
FIDO (Fast Identity Online) authentication standards were developed by the FIDO Alliance. FIDO2 is built on the WebAuthn and CTAP standards, where they are able to work together to create strong authentication experiences.

Below is a diagram that provides an overview of how FIDO2 creates the concert of WebAuthn and CTAP to perform authentication ceremonies. These are the foundational blocks that have gotten us to the current paradigm of passkeys.

Now that we have an understanding of the foundational points of how we got here, let’s dive into how passkeys keep users secure.
