== WebAuthn using iOS and Safari
Through this guide we are going to walk through developing a WebAuthn implementation for iOS using the Safari browser. This will provide guidance on how to ensure that you create a robust and seamless experience for your users when accessing your web application. 

This section assumes that you have some familiarity with WebAuthn and web development concepts including:

* PublicKeyRequestOptions and PublicKeyCreationOptions
* Platform authenticators vs cross-platform authenticators
* Javascript
* Event handlers in React

=== About our demo
Through the remainder of this series we will be leveraging screenshots and code samples from Yubico's WebAuthn Starter Kit V2.1. The Starter Kit includes a full reference architecture to help you build a full end-to-end WebAuthn application, and is available link:https://github.com/YubicoLabs/WebAuthnKit[here] on GitHub.
 
This demo will be utilizing Touch ID on a iPhone running iOS v15.4.1, and Safari v15.4.1 The security key used is a YubiKey 5 NFC v5.4.3.

=== Implementation guides for user scenarios
This section will provide different implementation guides for a variety of different user scenarios. Each scenario will highlight a specific WebAuthn related user scenario, and provide implementation how-toâ€™s required to create the experience.
